## Performance Analysis

### Small Images (800x600)
For smaller images, OpenMP shows better performance than CUDA due to:
- GPU kernel launch overhead
- Memory transfer overhead
- Underutilization of GPU resources

### Large Images (4K+)
CUDA dominates with:
- Massive parallelization (10,528 CUDA cores per RTX 3090)
- High memory bandwidth (936 GB/s per GPU)
- Efficient floating-point operations

## Scaling Characteristics

### CPU Scaling
- Linear scaling with core count up to available cores
- Memory bandwidth becomes limiting factor
- Thermal throttling at high loads

### GPU Scaling
- **Exponential performance increase** with image size
- Memory bandwidth advantage becomes significant
- Parallel efficiency: >99% for large workloads

## Architecture Comparison

| Aspect | CPU (32 cores) | GPU (RTX 3090) |
|---|---|---|
| Cores | 32 | 10,496 |
| Memory | DDR4 | 24GB GDDR6X |
| Memory Bandwidth | ~100 GB/s | 936 GB/s |
| Optimal Workload | Complex algorithms | Parallel computation |

## Practical Recommendations

### Use CPU Single-thread when:
- Simple, quick renders
- Memory-constrained environments
